			<img src="/thumbs/vid-thumb-ida-teaser-1.jpg" data-video="9sRVFO_w1Zc" data-title="IDA Teaser Trailer" data-description="A pet project to teach myself basic VFX that has since spiralled out of control and mutated into a feature film. <p> Directed, shot and edited by myself, and starring Ida Wibe Hagen as a genetically enhanced psychic being hunted down by a shady government agency - think 'Bourne Identity' with superpowers." />
			<img src="/thumbs/vid-thumb-short-fuse-1.jpg" data-video="rLwrOg513jk" data-title="Short Fuse" data-description="A short film I worked on with Smart Casual Pictures for the London 48 Hour Project 2013 (http://www.48hourfilm.com/en/london/). The theme we were given was superheroes. I was co-cinematographer and editor, which explains why we ended up with a girl who could shoot lightning. An exhausting but inspiring weekend with a great bunch of old and new friends." />
			<img src="/thumbs/vid-thumb-monkey-burgers-1.jpg" data-video="pz4PiR03uHY" data-description="(NSFW: I get full frontal in this and Pete gets his bum out). The third sketch in Pat Larder's web series Monkey Burgers, a surreal comedy revolving around myself and Pete Williams as lazy, inept students. Having the most VFX experience, I edited this as well as acted in it. If you enjoy this kind of humour, check out the full pilot episode we made." />
