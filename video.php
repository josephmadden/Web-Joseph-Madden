The book sold out within the hour and I’ve never seen so many people in a bookshop at one time. An all round great day out in a beautiful little town in Oxfordshire.<p>I wasn't going to turn up and take photos without filming it as well, so made this little video of the event. Luckily the staff in Waterstone's were very friendly and let me set up camp behind the till with all my gear.</p>"
